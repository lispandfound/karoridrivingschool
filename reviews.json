Marcel is a great teacher who is patient and understanding, and when I passed he too was pleased. I will be going back to Marcel for my full licence."

I kept driving on restricted license for nearly 10 years and failed test 4 times. Then I met Marcel and he gave me a dozen or so lessons. He has been very patient and taught me safe driving. After taking lessons from him I felt very confident and passed my test in 1 go. I am very thankful to Marcel for getting my driving license and giving me my freedom in case driving. He also helped getting restricted and full license for my daughter. Highly recommended."

He focused on areas where I needed the most improvement, and helped me gain confidence behind the wheel. His clear and concise instructions created a stress-free learning environment which was crucial to me passing the driving test first time! I highly recommend Marcel to anyone looking to learn how to drive safely and competently."

When I started lessons I was an anxious driver, my Learners was about to expire and I had very few hours of practical driving behind me. Marcel was just the teacher I needed, calm and patient, he built up my confidence driving around tight Wellington streets and busy highways. Thanks to his support I passed both my restricted and later my full on the first try (on the hardest course in the country)! My partner went on to get his restricted with Marcel a few years later and had the same great experience. I recommend him to anyone who's feeling nervous or has been putting off getting their license sorted, this is your guy!"
