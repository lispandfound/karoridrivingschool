              <p>
                Hi, my name is Marcel, a calm, friendly, and fully qualified driving instructor in Karori, Wellington. I coach driving in a thoughtful, supportive way, focusing on confidence, awareness, and safe decision-making.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have over 30 years of driving experience and have been instructing professionally since 2020. My students consistently achieve a very high driving test pass rate, and more importantly, leave lessons feeling confident and capable on Wellington roads.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a dad of two girls at different stages of life, I bring patience, perspective, and a focus on safety to every lesson. Karori has been my home since 2007, giving me strong local knowledge of Wellington’s roads, traffic conditions, and test routes. Before becoming a driving instructor, I worked in the TV news industry, where professionalism, calm under pressure, and clear communication were essential. I now run my driving school full time and genuinely enjoy helping people become safe, confident drivers.

                Lessons are conducted in a 2020 automatic Toyota Corolla Hybrid, fitted with dual controls which include an instructor brake and accelerator. This provides reassurance and safety, especially in complex or unfamiliar driving situations.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Corolla Hybrid is quiet, smooth, and comfortable — ideal for learning. It holds a 5-star ANCAP safety rating and includes advanced driver-assistance features such as:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Blind Spot Monitoring</li>
                <li>Adaptive Cruise Control</li>
                <li>Lane safety and collision-avoidance systems</li>
                <li>Multiple airbags and electronic stability control</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                These systems are actively incorporated into lessons, ensuring students understand how to use modern vehicle technology correctly and confidently — a key skill for today’s drivers.
