                Hi, my name is Marcel. I'm a calm, friendly, and qualified
                instructor that coaches driving in a positive way. I aim to make
                each lesson a fun and enjoyable hour. My driving experience
                stretches back more than 30 years, and I have been instructing
                since 2020. My students have a very high pass rate so you can
                trust me to prepare you with confidence for your test.
              </p>
              <p>
                I’m a dad to two teenage daughters. Karori has been my home
                since 2007. Prior to becoming an instructor, I was working in
                the TV-news industry. I now enjoy running my own driving school
                business full time. I lived in Switzerland for part of my life
                and speak German/Swiss German as a second language.

                The current vehicle is a 2016 automatic Toyota Aqua fitted with
                dual controls, so I have a brake and an accelerator to take the
                stress out of tricky situations. The Aqua is a great, little,
                and safe car to start your driving experience in.

                After each lesson, a feedback and progress chart is emailed to
                you, which tracks your driving skills. Once you meet test level,
                we'll practice on the Thorndon test route. Then, you are ready
